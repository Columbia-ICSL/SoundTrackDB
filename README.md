# 🏃‍♂️ SoundTrackDB

**SoundTrackDB** is a comprehensive dataset of treadmill running sounds, designed to support research and development in contactless running metric estimation.  

![Dataset Overview](./images/DB.png)

📊 **Highlights**:
- **40 hours** of audio data  
- **61 subjects**, **363 sessions**  
- Recorded in **13 public gyms**  
- Developed in collaboration with a **licensed running coach**

This dataset captures real-world variability and is ideal for training and evaluating ML models that estimate running metrics such as:
- **Cadence**
- **Ground Contact Time (GCT)**
- And many other possible metrics with our labels

# 📱 SoundTrack

We also introduce **SoundTrack**, a **contactless mobile solution** that estimates cadence and GCT by analyzing treadmill running sounds using **on-device machine learning** — no wearables required.
